Transaction Manager:
--------------------
@Transactional:
    -> Checks for active transaction, if not it will initiate a transaction.
    -> It acquires the connection needed for the transaction to complete.

Default Working of @Transactional:
    -> Without try-catch block.
    -> Only for un-checked exceptions.

To work with checked exceptions: @Transactional(rollbackFor = <checked-exception>.class)
    i.e. @Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)
         @Transactional(rollbackFor = IOException.class)

To skip even in un-checked exceptions: @Transactional(noRollbackFor = <un-checked-exception>.class)
    i.e. @Transactional(noRollbackFor = RuntimeException.class)

Note: Keeping the @Transactional on the dao/repo is not required if the service which calls
      the dao/repo methods is already have a @Transactional.

Propagation level: Gives us the convenience how we want to re-use the transaction on our methods.
    -> Use/Don't use the active transaction.
    -> Cancel/Suspend the active transaction.
    -> Create a new transaction.

Default Propagation property on @Transactional: REQUIRED
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)

Propagation:
------------
REQUIRED: Support a current transaction, create one if none exists.
SUPPORTS: Support a current transaction, execute non-transactionally if none exists.
MANDATORY: Support a current transaction, throw exception if none exists.
NOT_SUPPORTED: Execute non-transactionally, suspend the current transaction if one exists.
REQUIRES_NEW: Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.
NEVER: Execute non-transactionally, throw an exception if a transaction exists.
NESTED: Support a current transaction, but creates a savepoint.
	->If the nested transaction fails, only the changes after the savepoint are rolled back (not the outer transaction).
	->If the outer transaction fails, everything rolls back, including the nested one.
