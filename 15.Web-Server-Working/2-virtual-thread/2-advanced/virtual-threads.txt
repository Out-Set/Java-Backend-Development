Virtual Thread:
===============
 -> It doesn't have stack memory unlike platform threads.
 -> It is very light weight so It is just like any normal java objects.
 -> It works on the top of platform therad.
 -> It uses platform therad stack-memory for its works.
 
Mount: Binding between virtual-thread and platfrom-thread, after mounting platfrom-thread is referred as carrier-thread.
UnMount: Detachment of virtual-thread and platfrom-thread after virtual-thread finished its execution.
	 Since virtual-thread has finished its execution it is eligible for garbage-collection.

Note:
=====
 -> virtual-thread has one-to-one relationship with os-thread: NO
 -> platfrom(carrier)-thread has one-to-one relationship with os-thread: YES
 -> At any instance of time only one virtual-thread can run on the top of a platfrom-thread.
 -> If all the platfrom-thread is busy then virtual-thread will wait till JVM mount it with any platfrom-thread.
 -> Mounting and unmounting is handled by JVM.

Use virtual-thread only incase of I/O bound operations, for normal CPU bound operations platfrom-thread is much better.
