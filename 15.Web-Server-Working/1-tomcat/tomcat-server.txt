Tomcat Server:
==============
 -> It is based on the thread-per-request-model paradigm.
 -> It creates minimum 10 worker-threads and maximum 200 worker-threads in thread pool by default.
 -> Limit the worker-threads creation: server.tomcat.threads.max = <an integer value>
 -> Threads starting with below identifiers are worker threads, which handles the incomming requests.
 		(See the worker-threads in debug mode)
 		http-nio-<app-port>-exec-1 (status)
 		http-nio-<app-port>-exec-2 (status)
 		http-nio-<app-port>-exec-3 (status)
 		.....
 		.....
 		
 -> Worker-threads, status informations
		runnable: ready to accept/server requests.
		waiting: waiting to be scheduled.
 		running: currently serving/hadling the request.
 		suspended: suspended for some reason (i.e. in debug mode due to breakpoint on some lines)

Note: 
=====
 -> Either you use RestTemplate or you use RestClinet both are blocking call.
 -> Peoples prefer RestClinet because it is just more redable that RestTemplate.
 -> RestClinet internally uses CompletableFuture.get() and .get() is blocking in nature.
 -> One faulty API can take the entire application down.
