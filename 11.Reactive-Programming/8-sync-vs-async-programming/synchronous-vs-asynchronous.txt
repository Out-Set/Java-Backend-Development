Runnable and Callable Interface:
================================

Runnable Interface:
===================
public class TestRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
        thread.start();
        for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
            System.out.println("doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}

class Task implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<10; i++){
            System.out.println("doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
o/p:
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - Thread-0
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Callable Interface:
===================
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class TestCallable {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {

        // This will be creating threads behind the scene for you.
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
        Future<String> returnValueFromFuture  =executorService.submit(new CallableTask()); // non blocking
        for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
            System.out.println("doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
        
        // program go on hold and wait till the value appears
        System.out.println(returnValueFromFuture.get()); // blocking
    }
}

class CallableTask implements Callable<String> {
    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        for (int i=0; i<10; i++){
            System.out.println("doing some task by runnable.. , ran by thread - "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
        return "done doing my task";
    }
}
o/p:
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
done doing my task

so, if:
-------
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
Future<String> returnValueFromFuture  =executorService.submit(new CallableTask()); // non blocking

// program go on hold and wait till the value appears
System.out.println(returnValueFromFuture.get()); // blocking

for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
	System.out.println("doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
}
o/p: as you can see only after getting the value it proceeds further
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
doing some task by callable.. , ran by thread - pool-1-thread-1
done doing my task
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main
doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - main

So the base way to use Future:
------------------------------
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
Future<String> returnValueFromFuture  =executorService.submit(new CallableTask());
...
tasks...
tasks...
...
for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
	System.out.println("doing some task by main method.. , ran by thread - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
}
...
tasks...
tasks...
...
// In the last
System.out.println(returnValueFromFuture.get());
